### The Challenge
#### How can I write an EVEN better implementation of those Gzip compression examples?
        
##### Additional Asks/Constraints 
1) Continue to use `Stream` as a core mechanic.
2) Go nuts

#### Intro
Let's continue our work from the last [guide (part-two)](https://houseofcat.io/guides/csharp/net/compressionpartdeux).

We will be taking those well-done examples and bring in something used in high performance systems, the `RecyclableMemoryStream`.

Let's go ahead and acquire package
```csharp
Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream
```


```csharp
using Microsoft.IO;
```

I am going to begin with a global static wrapper I used around RecyclableMemoryStreamManager. This isn't super necessary for you to
do but since I have a copy of one already lying around, let's snag it.

```csharp
using Microsoft.IO;
using System;
using System.IO;

public static class RecyclableManager
{
    private static RecyclableMemoryStreamManager _manager = new RecyclableMemoryStreamManager();

    /// <summary>
    /// ConfigureStaticManager completely rebuilds the <c>RecyclableMemoryStreamManager</c> so try to call it only once, and on startup.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="blockSize"></param>
    /// <param name="largeBufferMultiple"></param>
    /// <param name="maximumBufferSize"></param>
    /// <param name="useExponentialLargeBuffer"></param>
    /// <param name="maximumSmallPoolFreeBytes"></param>
    /// <param name="maximumLargePoolFreeBytes"></param>
    public static void ConfigureNewStaticManager(
        int blockSize,
        int largeBufferMultiple,
        int maximumBufferSize,
        bool useExponentialLargeBuffer,
        long maximumSmallPoolFreeBytes,
        long maximumLargePoolFreeBytes)
    {
        _manager = new RecyclableMemoryStreamManager(blockSize, largeBufferMultiple, maximumBufferSize, useExponentialLargeBuffer, maximumSmallPoolFreeBytes, maximumLargePoolFreeBytes);
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// ConfigureStaticManagerWithDefaults completely rebuilds the <c>RecyclableMemoryStreamManager</c> so try to call it only once, and on startup.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="useExponentialLargeBuffer"></param>
    public static void ConfigureNewStaticManagerWithDefaults(bool useExponentialLargeBuffer = false)
    {
        var blockSize = 1024;
        var largeBufferMultiple = 4 * blockSize * blockSize;
        var maximumBufferSize = 2 * largeBufferMultiple;
        var maximumFreeLargePoolBytes = 32 * maximumBufferSize;
        var maximumFreeSmallPoolBytes = 256 * blockSize;

        _manager = new RecyclableMemoryStreamManager(blockSize, largeBufferMultiple, maximumBufferSize, useExponentialLargeBuffer, maximumFreeSmallPoolBytes, maximumFreeLargePoolBytes);
    }

    public static void SetGenerateCallStacks(bool input = true)
    {
        _manager.GenerateCallStacks = input;
    }

    public static void SetAggressiveBufferReturn(bool input = true)
    {
        _manager.GenerateCallStacks = input;
    }

    public static RecyclableMemoryStream GetStream()
    {
        return _manager.GetStream() as RecyclableMemoryStream;
    }

    public static RecyclableMemoryStream GetStream(string tag)
    {
        return _manager.GetStream(tag) as RecyclableMemoryStream;
    }

    public static RecyclableMemoryStream GetStream(string tag, int desiredSize)
    {
        return _manager.GetStream(tag, desiredSize) as RecyclableMemoryStream;
    }

    public static RecyclableMemoryStream GetStream(Memory<byte> buffer)
    {
        return _manager.GetStream(buffer) as RecyclableMemoryStream;
    }

    public static RecyclableMemoryStream GetStream(string tag, Memory<byte> buffer)
    {
        return _manager.GetStream(tag, buffer) as RecyclableMemoryStream;
    }

    public static RecyclableMemoryStream GetStream(string tag, Memory<byte> buffer, int start, int length)
    {
        return _manager.GetStream(tag, buffer.Slice(start, length)) as RecyclableMemoryStream;
    }

    public static void ReturnStream(MemoryStream stream)
    {
        stream.Dispose();
    }
}
```

I am not going to tell you exactly what works on the blockSize, bufferSize, maxes, mins, etc. because I wouldn't know what works for
your situation. You must figure that out for yourself based on your systems and payloads. I will say, every article's numbers I copied
while reading their guide on RecyclableMemoryStream *sucked shit* in terms of allocations and performance - over just default - when
benchmarking. It's possible that its just improved over time.

I have included my default setup, but this one only worked well for a segment of message sizes I was dealing with.
It's a specific use case and I am not convinced about even keeping this.

#### Important!  
If you do not set MaximumFreeLargePoolBytes and MaximumFreeSmallPoolBytes there is the possibility for unbounded memory growth!  
[Microsoft's README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream)

Once we have a reference to a centralized location for our `RecyclableManager`, we can begin using it everywhere! I am going to take
the final state of our last guide and start implementing `RecyclableMemoryStream` where feasible.

Up first is compression!
```csharp
using Microsoft.Toolkit.HighPerformance;
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Compression;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public string Type { get; } = "GZIP";
public CompressionLevel CompressionLevel { get; set; } = CompressionLevel.Optimal;

public ArraySegment<byte> Compress(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> inputData)
{
    // replaced
    //using var compressedStream = new MemoryStream();
    var compressedStream = RecyclableManager.GetStream(nameof(RecyclableGzipProvider));
    using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(compressedStream, CompressionLevel, false))
    {
        gzipStream.Write(inputData.Span);
    }

    if (compressedStream.TryGetBuffer(out var buffer))
    { return buffer; }
    else
    {
        using (compressedStream) // dispose stream after using ToArray()
        {
            return compressedStream.ToArray();
        }
    }
}
```

### Code Detour 1 - Right Out The Gate
Because we are adhering to the signature, we lost a bit of an advantage here. We extract the buffer from the `MemoryStream`, which
is then used by the developer, meaning it can be returned to the buffer pool. It will get discarded eventually but that isn't as
efficient as signaling a `RecyclableMemoryStream.Dispose()`.

In addition, from time to time under pressure, `TrytGetBuffer()` may indeed fail. In that scenario, we want to make sure that we
immediately `Dispose()` the `Stream` we `rented` from the `RecyclableManager` as we don't need it after using the `.ToArray()`
method.

This function, while still good for creating `MemoryStreams` backed by a buffer pool, is the second-best choice for lower memory
allocations. The first would be using `Stream`.

```csharp
public MemoryStream Compress(Stream inputStream, bool leaveStreamOpen = false)
{
    // reset position check
    if (inputStream.Position == inputStream.Length) { inputStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin); }

    // grab recycled stream
    var compressedStream = RecyclableManager.GetStream(nameof(RecyclableGzipProvider));
    using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(compressedStream, CompressionLevel, true))
    {
        inputStream.CopyTo(gzipStream);
    }
    if (!leaveStreamOpen) { inputStream.Close(); }

    // reset the position
    compressedStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
    return compressedStream;
}
```
The return now is the `MemoryStream` built from the `RecyclableMemoryStreamManager`.

Two important notes to remember.
 1. It can be cast to RecyclableMemoryStream.
 2. When finished with it, you have to remember to _**dispose**_ this `Stream`!

The disposable portion is super important to keep allocations low, as this (underneath the
covers) returns the buffer to the buffer pool.

Now that we have viable Compress methods, let's build the Decompress ones!
```csharp
public ArraySegment<byte> Decompress(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> compressedData)
{
    var uncompressedStream = RecyclableManager.GetStream(nameof(RecyclableGzipProvider), CompressionHelpers.GetGzipUncompressedLength(compressedData));
    using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(compressedData.AsStream(), CompressionMode.Decompress, false))
    {
        gzipStream.CopyTo(uncompressedStream);
    }

    if (uncompressedStream.TryGetBuffer(out var buffer))
    { return buffer; }
    else
    {
        // dispose stream after allocation.
        using (uncompressedStream)
        {
            return uncompressedStream.ToArray();
        }
    }
}

public MemoryStream Decompress(Stream compressedStream, bool leaveStreamOpen = false)
{
    if (compressedStream.Position == compressedStream.Length) { compressedStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin); }

    var uncompressedStream = RecyclableManager.GetStream(nameof(RecyclableGzipProvider), CompressionHelpers.GetGzipUncompressedLength(compressedStream));
    using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(compressedStream, CompressionMode.Decompress, leaveStreamOpen))
    {
        gzipStream.CopyTo(uncompressedStream);
    }

    return uncompressedStream;
}
```

The Decompress method has the same weakness as the first Compress method. To get the lowest allocations, you have to be returning
out the `Stream` that you can then dispose of afterwards.

### Code Detour 2 - Optimal Implementation
If you are using the Recyclable classes from my library, you will want an implementation that looks like this. I have included one
under Houseofcat.Data.Recyclable called the `RecyclableTransformer`.

This is a snippet of it under the hood.

```csharp
using HouseofCat.Compression;
using HouseofCat.Encryption;
using HouseofCat.Recyclable;
using HouseofCat.Serialization;
using HouseofCat.Utilities.Errors;
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace HouseofCat.Data.Recyclable
{
    public class RecyclableTransformer
    {
        public readonly RecyclableAesGcmEncryptionProvider EncryptionProvider;
        public readonly RecyclableGzipProvider CompressionProvider;
        public readonly ISerializationProvider SerializationProvider;

        public RecyclableTransformer(
            ISerializationProvider serializationProvider,
            RecyclableGzipProvider compressionProvider,
            RecyclableAesGcmEncryptionProvider encryptionProvider)
        {
            Guard.AgainstNull(serializationProvider, nameof(serializationProvider));
            Guard.AgainstNull(compressionProvider, nameof(compressionProvider));
            Guard.AgainstNull(encryptionProvider, nameof(encryptionProvider));

            SerializationProvider = serializationProvider;
            CompressionProvider = compressionProvider;
            EncryptionProvider = encryptionProvider;
        }

        public MemoryStream TransformToStream<TIn>(TIn input)
        {
            using var serializedStream = RecyclableManager.GetStream(nameof(RecyclableTransformer));
            SerializationProvider.Serialize(serializedStream, input);

            using var compressedStream = CompressionProvider.Compress(serializedStream, false);

            return EncryptionProvider.Encrypt(compressedStream, false);
        }

        public (ArraySegment<byte>, long) Transform<TIn>(TIn input)
        {
            using var serializedStream = RecyclableManager.GetStream(nameof(RecyclableTransformer));
            SerializationProvider.Serialize(serializedStream, input);

            using var compressedStream = CompressionProvider.Compress(serializedStream, false);
            var encryptedStream = EncryptionProvider.Encrypt(compressedStream, false);

            var length = encryptedStream.Length;
            if (encryptedStream.TryGetBuffer(out var buffer))
            { return (buffer, length); }
            else
            { return (encryptedStream.ToArray(), length); }
        }

        public TOut Restore<TOut>(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> data)
        {
            using var decryptStream = EncryptionProvider.DecryptToStream(data);
            using var decompressStream = CompressionProvider.Decompress(decryptStream, false);
            return SerializationProvider.Deserialize<TOut>(decompressStream);
        }

        public TOut Restore<TOut>(MemoryStream data)
        {
            using var decryptedStream = EncryptionProvider.Decrypt(data, false);
            using var decompressedStream = CompressionProvider.Decompress(decryptedStream, false);
            return SerializationProvider.Deserialize<TOut>(decompressedStream);
        }
    }
}
```

A couple of my HouseofCat libraries really are meant to streamline taking an object `<TIn>` and outputting serialized, compressed,
and encrypted bytes and then the ability to `Restore` that back to the original object! You should check them out if you are in
the market for streamlining portions of system.

### Benchmarks
There is always room for improvement, but this seems pretty damn good as an out-of-the-box improvement!

It's relatively painless to implement and on average, led to an 88% reduction in byte allocations for
non-random data (xml, json, plaintext, etc.) Amounts/variance will occur on how compressible an item
is of course so your mileage will vary (be sure to test!)

### Conclusion
Memory allocation optimizations can be a huge boon to plain-ole throughput. When you start reaching the scale of thousands of requests,
maybe tens of thousands of requests a second, you start finding these issues quickly. Speaking in generality, most devs/managers/product
owners start talking about scaling up immediately. I know, I know, Cloud hardware solves are often cheaper than devs, but those costs can
be just as prohibitive. Back in the day you couldn't easily throw hardware at your problems. Considering how easy it is to implement, basically
just leaving free performance on the table.

There isn't anything special about these three Compression guides or code snippets. The only potential secret sauce was taking
something mundane like Compression, something you may have see on StackOverflow answered a thousand times and just not taking the first popularly upvoted
answer. Instead, I challenged myself with some interesting constraints.

In my actual use case, I was working on my library and I wanted it to be as lean and clean as humanly possible so devs
can get more free/out-of-the-box performance. I hope you found it useful expedition regardless and helped exposed you to some of the
newer tricks coming out of C#/NetCore land in recent years!
