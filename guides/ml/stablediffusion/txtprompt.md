### StableDiffusion v2.1 - Introduction to Text Prompts!

#### Intro  

I have written a guide for setting up AUTOMATIC1111's stable diffusion locally over 
[here]().

#### AUTOMATIC1111 Text Prompt Syntax

So one of the useful features of using AUTOMATIC1111's web-ui for stable diffusion as 
it adds very powerful tools to really create more usefully accurate images.

```text
Attention, specify parts of text that the model should pay more attention to
 - a man in a ((tuxedo)) - will pay more attention to tuxedo
 - a man in a (tuxedo:1.21) - alternative syntax
 - select text and press ctrl+up or ctrl+down to automatically adjust attention to selected text (code contributed by anonymous user)
 ```
